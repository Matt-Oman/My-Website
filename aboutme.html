          <h3>High School</h3>
          <p>I attended Fairfax High School, Graduating in the spring of 2022. I took Computer science classes in both Python and Java. This is where my interest in technology and coding began to grow.

          <p>Shortly after getting my license I became very interested in everything related to cars. This would lead me to find out that I also really enjoy taking pictures, combining both of those together has been one of my favorite hobbies ever since.</p>

          <h3>Eagle Project</h3>
          <p>Here is my eagle project! I worked with my local elementary school, Daniels Run Elementary, to add structures to their outdoor classroom to assist in their ability to teach outdoors as this was still pandemic time. This project was lead entirely by me, from idea to reality with all the necessary planning and preparation. Additionally I was the leader of the project on the site and guided my peers to ensure the plans were carried out correctly.

          <h3>College</h3>
          <p>I applied to many colleges, and I ended up choosing to attend George Mason University. I am majoring in Information Technology with a concentration in cybersecurity, with one of my first coding languages being python. I did well enough in the intro Python class  in spring, that I was tapped to be a TA for the course over the summer immediately following the course.</p>

          <h3>Lake Anna</h3>
          <p>In my Freshman year of college, I started learning how to wakeboard. This has become one of my favorite summer activities in addition to fishing. Being able to work as a TA remotely was great as I was able to pursue wakeboarding while still working. To see a fun video, click <a href="./videopage.html">here!</a></p>
